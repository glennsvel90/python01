Hello Fellows!

#Open the file romeo.txt 

#read it line by line. 

# For each line, split the line into a list of words 

Begin to write the program with the following code below:
fname = raw_input("Enter file name: ")
fh = open(fname)
lst = list()
for line in fh:
	lst=line.rstrip().split()

	for word in lst:
		if word not in lst:
			lst.append(word)


print lst


# For each word on each line check to see if the word is 
# already in the list and if not append it to the list.




# When the program completes, sort and print the 
# resulting words in alphabetical order.
